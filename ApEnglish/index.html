          <p><span class="headline hl2">"A revolution in traditional halls"</span></p>
        </div><p>As school funding continues to decrease across the entire nation, many schools have been competing nationally to reduce their building maintenance expenses. Right here in Provo, Timpview High School takes the lead with the cheapest maintenance fees yet. Engineers were flown in from all over the world to analyze Timpview's budget. After long hours of research, and many millions of dollars, it was decided that the best way to save money would be to eradicate the cost, right from the root—or the foundation.</p>

            <p>While using walls on both sides of the hallway was traditional, it is no longer worth the cost of maintenance. One student said, "I think that utilizing the revolutionary 'One-Wall Hall System' idea will benefit the student body significantly. We will be able to enjoy nature and the natural weather as we walk to our classes. We might even have more walking space to get to our destinations!" Not only will the "One-Wall Hall" System benefit the school financially, but will be a positive experience for the students. Research shows exposure to nature helps students academically. For example, one study, The Effect of Temperatures Below Freezing on the level of fatigue Students Experience, showed that exposure to these elements would help the students wake up, enabling them to perform better throughout their day.</p>

            <p>After a few more weeks of research, the school district decided that they would no longer continue to have the "commons", which was an intersection connecting multiple wings of the school. The commons was considered even an overly inefficient waste of space, as it never contributed to one's ability to get to classes quickly.</p>

						</figure>
          
        <p>While at the demolition of the commons, the contractors got a little too excited with destruction and obliterated the entire old "A-wing" hall in the school. The contractor's mistake was forgivable because "A-wing" offices and auditorium foyer, running parallel to the removed hall were able to become the new walkway.</p>
        <p>All of these changes to the school will continue to save even more money and allow the school to budget for other expenses.</p>

     <p><span class="headline hl2">An impact that will make history</span></p>
   
   </div><p>Day after day millions of people pollute the world. Day after day greenhouse gases are building in the atmosphere, covering the Earth. Day after day these gases build up, creating the "Greenhouse Effect". Year after year the temperatures are on the rise. Few people realize the significance of global warming, and even fewer do something about it. Timpview is the first school in history to make a stance against climate change.</p>

        <p>Timpiew announced at the beginning of the year they wouldn't only just have a smaller carbon footprint, but also a plan to actively combat global warming. The plan is to help actually lower the temperatures in the atmosphere. The principal stated, "Everyone seems to only acknowledge the looming crisis. Nobody else actually has tried to make a difference. Timpview is proud to be the first school in history to actively make that difference." </p>
 
						
            <p><span class="citation">Timpview's Actions</span>
              In participating classes, the temperature has been set to just a little below freezing. The cold air is then able to be released into the environment where the difference can really be made.</p>
     
            <p>In these classrooms, both the teachers and the students are sacrificing for the fight against global warming. It is observed the populations in these classrooms are wearing full coats, gloves, and hats to keep warm. 
            </p>
     <p>One student said, "Even though it's cold, I feel good about what we are doing. I know that the sacrifices I make every day in Sutherland's english class in 32° degrees, will save the penguins, and tomorrow's generation."</p>
<p>Last Tuesday, Timpview received an award from the state for having the biggest impact against climate change. The award was $100,000 for the school's personal use and a new AC unit because the older one was starting to show signs of age. The money will likely be used in a few months to purchase another AC unit, as they seem to only last a few months at this temperature, the school's principal told us Tuesday.</p>
